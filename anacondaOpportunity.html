            Myself, Jonathan and Spencer spent two weeks hiking through some of the grandest locations in the world.
            We spent 3 days in the High Uintas Wilderness, 2 days in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, and then 6 days in Glacier National park,
            5 nights of which would be spent in the backcountry. such walking. many altitude. Wow.

            Our primary goal here was to climb Kings Peak. The general route for which you
            can see to the left. The route from Henry's Fork Trailhead consists of
            <b>30 miles</b>, round trip, from 9440ft to <b>13,527ft</b>; however, in contrast to previous
            summitings when I have done it 2 days or even once in 1 day (14hrs), we would take 3 days and 2 nights
            to adjust to altitude as well as take the requisite time to really enjoy this area.

            With the increase in altitude, the air was getting thin. Gunsight pass is just under 12,000ft, and
            there are two options for getting to the peak. Traverse the ridge; requireing a fair bit of scrambling, some
            climbing, and good balance, or descending east into painter basin to then circle around and
            turn back west and ascend again arriving right at the foot of the peak. We opted for the decent into the basin this time, but we would take the
            ridge cutoff on the way back.

            I'd made it to the summit before Jon and Spencer, and I had the peak to myself for about 30 minutes.

              We had arrived in time to secure a campsite at Coulter Bay campground, and it wasn't too long until something happened..
              something for which Spencer got his embarrasigly apt nickname "3-Alarm." He earned his new moniker by trying to cheat the system.
              Cheating the system of propane canisters and stoves, something of which the often quoted Hank Hill would greatly disapprove, yet
              such character's fictional existence rendered his wise words unheard as spencer lit a stove with another already lit stove.
              This caused the one he was holding to erupt into a maltov of impending doom, so he tossed it into the middle of the gravel street, and
              luckily it eventually burned itself out and was disposed of, but not before park law enforcement and fire crews arrived and Jon's and my faces

            Backcountry pass in hand, err. rather zip tied to my backpack, we set off into the smoky wilderness.
            We had a hard time coming up with an itinerary at the ranger station, as much of the park was closed due to active, yet uncontrolled
            fires in the area. We did manage to piece one together; however, each day was consistently packed with high milage and altitude change.
            Due to this, the ranger had marked our permit with "itinerary not recommended."

            The above photo of epic 3D tic-tac-toe and beers betrays the sense of contiguous nights spent in the backcountry proper for the whole 6 days, as
            part of what it took to make the itinerary work with the craze of demand for backcountry camp areas was to utilize a night
            in Many Glacier Campground's backcountry only spots. This was to be the second night, and we would then head out again for the 4 remaining days in the backcountry.

                We made our way from Many Glacier 14.5 miles north to Gable Creek by means of the Ptermagen pass tunnel.
                The smoke had almost miraculously cleared the night before, and the views were excelent and clear this day and for the the next two.

          We spent the night in Gable Creek, and the next day we would actually do a bit of backtracking to get to Helen Lake campground,
          but it was worth it. We stopped at Lake Elisabeth along the way for some rock skipping and hanging out to rest up. I pulled out my
          fishing gear and set out for an hour or so of fishing, as it's currently free and doesn't require a state license in Glacier Park.

            I managed to get 4 fish caught among plenty of nibbles. One of which in particular
            was a considerably fatty rainbow trout, which I managed to reel in on 3lb test with a bumb clutch in the reel causing it to not be able to hold.
            Thus it was a valiant battle, yet of course without having brought my trusty camera with which to document my galavant along the lakeside, I thus lack photographic evidence of this, and like so many before,
            this story will go down in the annals of guys' big fish tall tales as simply yet another.

          The night at Helen lake proved windy with the howling gales audible through the night as they
          screeched over the cirque which holds Helen lake. My battery having been exhausted trying to pull off long exposures of an
          unobscured milky way in a moonless sky, I was not able to take additional photos. But from here, we would hike another 15 miles
          to Poia lake, and then yet another 8 miles back to the car in the morning with the smoke back in full force. Walking out, we could even
          feel the heat of fires brought up the draw by the changing wind.

          We drove back to Salt Lake City, completely obedient of the posted yet legendarily unenforced speed limits through the Montana native reservation land.
          We spent a couple days in SLC, and then caravaned back to California.
