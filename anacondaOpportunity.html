            Myself, Jonathan and Spencer spent two weeks hiking through some of the grandest locations in the world.
            We spent 3 days in the High Uintas Wilderness, 2 days in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, and then 6 days in Glacier National park,
            5 nights of which would be spent in the backcountry. such walking. many altitude. Wow.
          </p>

          <p>
            So first, as was the first place to where we went, we start in...
          </p>

          <h3>Utah</h3>
          <p>
            Our primary goal here was to climb Kings Peak. The general route for which you
            can see to the left. The route from Henry's Fork Trailhead consists of
            <b>30 miles</b>, round trip, from 9440ft to <b>13,527ft</b>; however, in contrast to previous
            summitings when I have done it 2 days or even once in 1 day (14hrs), we would take 3 days and 2 nights
            to adjust to altitude as well as take the requisite time to really enjoy this area.

            The altitude was getting thin. Gunsight pass is just under 12,000ft, and
            there are two options for getting to the peak. Traverse the ridge; requireing a fair bit of scrambling, some
            climbing, and good balance, or descending east into painter basin to then circle around and
            turn back west and ascend again arriving right at the foot of the peak. We opted for the decent into the basin this time, but we would take the
            ridge cutoff on the way back.

              something for which Spencer got his embarrasigly apt nickname "3-Alarm." He earned his new moniker by trying to cheat the system.
              Cheating the system of propane canisters and stoves, something of which the often quoted Hank Hill would greatly disapprove, yet
              such character's fictional existence rendered his wise words unheard as spencer lit a stove with another already lit stove.
              This caused the one he was holding to erupt into a maltov of impending doom, so he tossed it into the middle of the gravel street, and
              luckily it eventually burned itself out and was disposed of, but not before park law enforcement and fire crews arrived and Jon's and my faces
